<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> I had a normal childhood. My interests included sports, playing outside with my friends, and building and creating things. 
   Buildings were my favorite thing. From elementary to middle school, I enjoyed building Legos and playing RPG games that allowed me to build things out, like cities and kingdoms on a map.
   Mom was a school teacher, and Dad was a mechanic. My parents were crucial to my development from a boy to a man. Mom taught me a lot of 
   literature and the importance of school while taking me to the library every day after school. While dad taught me everything about hard work. 
   On weekends, instead of playing with my friends and watching cartoons. He often had me outside doing yard work and cleaning cars. I developed a strong work ethic 
   from my parents growing up, which transitioned well to my adult life.

  As an adult, I am 34 and married to my college sweetheart, Adrionna. We currently have three kids and one on the way. My wife has been a cornerstone in my life. She supported me during school and throughout my life as an entrepreneur. She is a fantastic wife and mother, and I would not have the current accomplishments in my life without her
   I am a very proud husband and father.
  When it comes to my professional life. I work in logistics as a field specialist/service provider for UPS. I've been working for UPS since I was 18 years old. UPS has done
  great by me and my family. Throughout my twenties, I've studied a lot about companies and technology. I grew a love and strong interest in tech companies. I will sometimes stay up at night thinking about ideas and concepts.
   These habits and knowledge gave me the confidence to start a company. So, I founded StitchGrab Inc.

   I founded StitchGrab in 2021 and am currently the CEO and Co-founder. I founded the company with my close friends, who helped build the foundation for It. StitchGrab is a tech company based in Miami, Florida. It is an online multivendor marketplace for locals. Our goal is to make fashion more accessible with same-day delivery. 
   We are currently in the last cycle of our developmental process. We will be launching our beta 2024 sometime this year. I am very happy with the direction of our company and what's ahead in the future.
